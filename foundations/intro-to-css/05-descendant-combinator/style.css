.container {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

/*.container works, but i guess .container.text would be better????? for small issue this is fine.
Later on need to be more specific with .countainer.text so nothing gets CSSd by accident. I need to remind
myself that I need to be more precise to not style unwanted code*/
